DEPRECATION WARNING: [Devise] config.email_regexp will have a new default on Devise 4.1
To keep the current behavior please set in your config/initializers/devise.rb the following:

  Devise.setup do |config|
    config.email_regexp = /\A[^@\s]+@([^@\s]+\.)+[^@\W]+\z/
  end

If you want to use the new default:

  Devise.setup do |config|
    config.email_regexp = /\A[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\z/
  end
